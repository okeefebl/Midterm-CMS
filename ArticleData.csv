1001,"Addressing Requests for Reconsideration at the Public Library Part One: Biblical Dinosaurs","Jacqui ","Higgins-Dailey","MikeAMorrison [CC BY-SA]","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Dinosaurs-730x948.jpg","","I became a collection development librarian about two years ago. Before that, I assumed that most of the challenged books in public libraries fell into the familiar categories we see in the “frequently banned and challenged” lists that are featured during Banned Books Week: Harry Potter; Go Ask Alice; Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. I was wrong. The requests I’ve received are not well-known titles, but they are for pretty standard reasons – religious or (perceived) sexual content. Phoenix Public Library gets very few requests for reconsideration each year but most of them are for children’s materials, which is not a surprise. Parents are concerned about the materials that their children consume, as they should be – but oftentimes this results in their desire to remove materials for all children.","Open Access Advocates Celebrate","As it happens, there was a request for reconsideration waiting for me to research on my first day of work in the collection development department. The title was Dinosaurs for Kids by Ken Ham. The request came from a parent concerned about being misled by the book’s title. The book was shelved in 567.9 (dinosaurs) but the information within the book was a biblical interpretation of the timeline of when dinosaurs walked the earth. The parent was concerned that it was shelved with the other books about dinosaurs from a scientific perspective and requested that the library remove the book or shelve in a religious section.","Publishers Protest ","This was a tricky question because it is imperative, as public librarians, we offer materials for people who ascribe to a variety of different belief systems. But, the title in question did not fit with the standard scientific theories on when dinosaurs walked the earth, claimed that humans and dinosaurs walked the earth together, and that dinosaurs were created on Day 6, when God created animals.","Academics Organizations Speaking for Their Members","So, I did what librarians do best – I researched. I read the entire book and confirmed it was a religious interpretation of dinosaurs from a biblical perspective. I noted that it specifically gave tips on how to refute scientific theories on evolution. Then, I looked at where this item was shelved in other libraries, using WorldCat to find other systems in AZ that had this title, and found that they were shelved in the religious section – either 231.7 (divine law and miracles) or 220.859 (biblical animals). With this information, I consulted with our collection manager and we both determined it would make the most sense to shelve the title in 220.859. I crafted a letter to share our determination with the customer who made the request.","Overhauling Academic Publishing","In my time in the role of children & teen collection development librarian, we have not removed any materials from the library. As librarians, we know removing offending materials isn’t a feasible solution and usually explaining our selection policies and reasons we will retain the book is enough to satisfy our customers. This has been the case, so far, with all of the titles that have come across my desk with requests for removal. Every title has come as a surprise to me – whether the reason for request has been a surprise – or the information found within the material. I look forward to sharing the other titles and my personal pointers and tips for how to deal with these types of requests. How do you approach requests for reconsideration? How often do people challenge titles that you have selected? Does your library have a policy and procedure to address requests for reconsideration?","","","","","","","","","","","2020-04-01 12:00:00",0
1002,"Academic Publishing, Open Access, and the Trump Administration","Kate ","Letchenberg","Dinosours for Kids By, Ken Ham","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/openaccess-300x113.png","","Last month, it was first reported in E&E News that the Trump administration is considering issuing an executive order requiring that all scientific research funded by federal grants be immediately published via open access. Such an action would expand on the Obama administration’s 2013 executive order stipulating that one year after publication, federally funded research would be freely available to the taxpayers who funded it, unfettered by publishers’ paywalls. ","Open Access Advocates Celebrate","When I first read these headlines, I thought, “Now here’s an executive administration that I can get behind!” As a librarian, I believe in providing as much access to information as possible; as a scholar, I want my work in the hands of as many people as possible and I want free access to my colleagues’ work; and as an educator, I want my students to have access to the most current research. (Aside: Honestly, this executive order wouldn’t affect qualitative researchers like me, given that qualitative research is not funded by federal grants at the same rates as quantitative.) Indeed, proponents of open access policies are celebrating. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), a coalition of academic librarians (which includes members from my own institution, the University of Iowa) has published a letter of support for the possible executive action, citing Europe’s “Plan S” as a reference for other nations’  general support for open access.","Publishers Protest","Predictably, academic publishers are not happy. One hundred and twenty-five “leading publishers and non-profit scientific societies in the U.S.” co-signed a letter of protest, claiming that removing the one-year moratorium might “jeopardize the intellectual property of American organizations engaged in the creation of high-quality peer-reviewed journals and research articles and would potentially delay the publication of new research results.”  Overall, the publishers are concerned that such a move would interfere with their business model and profit margins. I’m sure it would, and as a scholar who currently seeks publication without remuneration in multiple academic journals, I can’t say I have a lot of pity for the publishing companies making profit margins that rival Amazon’s, Google’s, and Apple’s, according to a 2017 article in The Guardian.","Academics Organizations Speaking for Their Members","Given my own initial reaction of celebration and the support of the Open Access community, I was surprised to see the American Educational Research Association, an organization of which I am a member, send out a letter to its constituents saying that it had co-signed a similar letter of protest along with over 60 other academic organizations. Explaining the choice to sign this letter of protest, AERA Executive Director Felice J. Levine said, “We believe that an even more open policy is feasible and potentially even desirable, but we urge, as in the past, that there be an open period of input to arrive at optimal feasible solutions.” Indeed, the letter AERA co-signed concludes with a call for collaboration: “Rather than upsetting the current proven and successful model for reporting, curating and archiving scientific results and advancing the U.S. research enterprise, we encourage your Administration to engage with a broad array of stakeholders to collaboratively ensure openness and reliability in research and development. To that end, we stand ready to work with all interested parties in a forward-looking and constructive manner.”I can certainly understand and appreciate the call for a thoughtful approach to changing the current policy and reforming academic publishing, but as one member of AERA, I would disagree with the description of the current academic publishing systems as a “proven and successful model.” While the system does provide for rigorous peer review, it is a model currently serves the financial interests of publishers more than scholars or universities. Steven Salzberg, of Johns Hopkins University, was quoted in Nature about the gap between organizations and their constituents: “I really doubt that most of those scientific and medical organizations made any attempt to poll their members about this issue.” I would be very curious to see a large-scale survey of published scholars’ views on this executive order and academic publishing as a whole.","Overhauling Academic Publishing","Yes, the debate over the Trump administration’s possible actions on scientific research raises larger questions about the academic publishing industry as a whole.   Mackenzie Smith, University Librarian and Vice Provost for Digital Scholarship at the University of California, Davis, recently wrote about the UC system’s efforts to change their relationships with publishers and move toward open access. “Maybe it’s time to just blow up the whole system and start over,” she muses. Her article is a great primer on the complexities of the academic publishing system, and she proposes useful suggestions about how to move forward, maintaining the integrity of research and peer review, while increasing access. I hope that the discussion around open access and academic publishing continues and that changes are made to move toward a system that respects the intellectual contributions of scholars and the needs of the public more than the profits of academic publishers. I don’t think it will be as simple as this rumored executive order, and I do hope the Trump administration engages with all stakeholders to move forward in pursuit of open access.","","So, I did what librarians do best – I researched. I read the entire book and confirmed it was a religious interpretation of dinosaurs from a biblical perspective. I noted that it specifically gave tips on how to refute scientific theories on evolution.

1003,"Church-Pike 2.0: How Fake News Enabled Real Surveillance Abuses","Sarah ","Hartman-Caverly","Excerpt from the Department of Justice Inspector General December 2019 report,","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NSA_training_twohop-1024x760.png","Untold numbers of Americans likely had their personal communications snagged in yet another","Untold numbers of Americans likely had their personal communications snagged in yet another FISA surveillance dragnet  — and no one is talking about it.  Edward Snowden’s 2013 disclosures of NSA capabilities prompted the last national conversation about electronic surveillance and civil liberties. This discussion is newly relevant given the Department of Justice Inspector General December 2019 report detailing faults in the FISA-sanctioned surveillance of a member of a national political campaign, preceded days earlier by the FISA Court’s rebuke of factual errors and omissions in the same FBI FISA application, and 2017 findings of significant noncompliance in NSA, FBI, and CIA use of FISA Section 702 metadata.  Exploratory analysis published by Stanford’s Computer Security Laboratory in 2016 concludes that, for every target of surveillance, current practices allow agencies like the NSA to collect metadata from approximately 25,000 additional people. Using a process called contact chaining or the two-hop rule, intelligence analysts begin their queries with a ‘seed’ target of surveillance, and can gather information about communications between that seed and their direct contacts (first hop), and from those primary contacts to secondary contacts (second hop). This is a useful method to identify the key players in a terrorist conspiracy, and also increases the risk for incidental collection of personal data on entirely innocent individuals. ","","So, where is the media coverage to inform corrective action and public oversight? Given the media’s unprecedented overt access to former intelligence officials  — many outlets retain them as paid contributors — thorough and nuanced analysis of state surveillance practices in light of current events doesn’t seem like too much to ask. Though former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe appear regularly on NCB News/MSNBC and CNN, they are more likely to be roasting the current administration than to be roasted by investigative journalists. Likewise, former FBI director James Comey is a frequent contributor to the opinion pages of the Washington Post and New York Times, from which his memos launched three thousand subpoenas. But establishment media has still not thought to inquire precisely how many United States residents’ personal data was examined, even unmasked or operationalized, in the dragnet of FISA’s two-hop rule. ","So, where is the media coverage to inform corrective action and public oversight?","Any such attempt to hold power to account would threaten the pipeline of intel and innuendo from the intelligence community that powers the mass media rumor mill. Take the “salacious and unverified” Steele dossier, which the aforementioned Horowitz report called “central and essential” in meeting the probable cause threshold for the FBI’s FISA application. The dossier was an open secret within the DC media, which refrained from reporting on it pending some semblance of verification. CNN first broke news of the dossier — citing Comey’s presidential briefing in determining it newsworthy — and was swiftly one-upped when BuzzFeed published the document in full. Comey, for his part, cited the potential for reporters to use dossier content as a “news hook” in his rationale for briefing the president. And it was Comey’s disclosure of the Midyear Exam investigation that prompted Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, co-founders of Fusion GPS which hired Christopher Steele, to leak the dossier to David Corn at Mother Jones as part of a broader pressure campaign aimed at the FBI. At the same time, Steele himself was providing Fusion GPS-funded off-the-record briefings to New York Times, Washington Post, and Yahoo! News, which the FBI then referenced in its FISA application as open-source intelligence to buttress the dossier’s credibility. ","","Thus “multiple layers of hearsay upon hearsay” derived from opposition research and validated by the surveillance-industrial complex sustained countless news segments and worked the chyron alerts overtime. The FBI and CIA competed to shape the media narrative. The New York Times and Washington Post shared a Pulitzer. On the intelligence side of the equation, the FBI was swayed by the media’s beatification of Steele, cited news stories to support their FISA application, and burned a CIA source; and the claim of state secrets privilege shielded the entire FISA process from oversight. Howard Fineman offered this boil down to media critic Eric Wemple: “bad oppo + zealous feds = bad journalism, erosion of the rule of law and threats to civil liberties.” ","Excerpt from the Department of Justice Inspector General December 2019 report, Review of Four FISA Applications and Other Aspects of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane Investigation.   ","Forty-five years ago, members of the Church and Pike committees reached similar conclusions. The progenitors of contemporary congressional committees tasked with intelligence oversight, Church and Pike investigated the excesses of the FBI, CIA, and NSA. Tucked amid revelations of assassination plots, exotic weapons, and human experimentation were accounts of politicized abuses of the state surveillance apparatus, and manipulation of public sentiment and public policy through mass media. Church and Pike unveiled covert intelligence operations in both the domestic and foreign press (the CIA’s Warren Commission conspiracy theory directive is one such example); not long after, Carl Bernstein detailed the media’s ofttimes witting complicity. Book II of the Church Committee’s report discusses “The Adverse Impact of Improper Intelligence Activity,” including media manipulation, distorting facts to influence policy and the public, chilling the exercise of First Amendment freedoms, and the disruption of innocent people’s day-to-day lives — not to mention the material costs. When Pike pointedly asked CIA Director William Colby whether anyone working in television or wire services like the AP was on the CIA payroll, Colby demurred: “This, I think, is getting into the details, Mr. Chairman, that I would like to discuss in executive session.” That was in 1975, the Year of Intelligence. Funny, then, that the current degree of media exposure enjoyed by modern intelligence officials should have led to so many years of unintelligence.  As an intellectual freedom scholar, I take particular interest in the efforts to censor, disparage as conspiracy theorists, or dehumanize as Russian bots the many people who came to recognize these codependent media-surveillance industrial complex abuses for what they are. But it’s no matter.  They’re burning the strawmen for fuel. ","","Forty-five years ago, members of the Church and Pike committees reached similar conclusions.

In one such email dated January 6, 2020, YouTube made the move to become compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Rule (COPPA). Videos now must be designated by the creator as made for kids or not. YouTube no longer serves personalized ads or supports comments, Stories, live chat, the notification bell, among other features on videos designated made for children.  For reference, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) summarizes COPPA as the imposition of “certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.” ","","In the January 6, 2020 email, YouTube writes that “all creators would be required to designate their content as made for kids or not made for kids in YouTube Studio, and that personal information from anyone watching a video designated as made for kids would be treated as coming from a child, regardless of the age of the user.” This protects kids from targeted advertising, data collection, and communication with other YouTube profiles — at least when kids are watching made for kids videos. However, many YouTubers complain that it puts the burden of judgement on the creator, which in turn opens YouTube creators to FTC audits. Many do not want to lose out on their financial gain that comes with running targeted advertising on their videos. Like much of the Internet, YouTube is not as innocent as it used to be. It is the end of an era for the website.","","Individuals must be 13 or older in order to create a YouTube account. In that regard, YouTube has always been compliant. The reality is that individuals younger than 13 use YouTube and therein lies the problem that got them into trouble in 2019. They made millions by illegally collecting data from minors without a guardian’s consent. They were ordered to pay $170 million by the FTC, which is historically the largest penalty given to a company for violating COPPA. YouTube is not the only company that has sent out emails about new data collection and privacy policies. I have received similar emails from Etsy and Canva. With the California Consumer Privacy Rule (CPPA) recently going into effect, 2020 seems to be sharing up as the year for being mindful of online hygiene. ","What about Libraries?","Many libraries have YouTube accounts or videos uploaded to YouTube from individual employee accounts related to library business. The Library and Information Science (LIS) profession is a bit better equipped to comply with YouTube’s new policy than a YouTuber who was not already familiar with COPPA prior to 2019. School librarians and educators might be the most familiar LIS professionals with this legislation. The issue in school libraries is pretty black and white. For many school librarians, none of their users are older than 13 and that will never change. Public libraries must also be mindful of COPPA legislation. It gets trickier when the population of users is comprised of infants to 100-year-olds. Public library patrons of all ages use services provided not by the library but by third-party vendors. The vendors are hired by the library but are not actually part of the library. Public library workers, are you confident with the privacy policies of all your library’s third-party vendors and how those vendors are compliant with COPPA?  As with YouTube’s new policy, many school and public librarians are on their own when assessing privacy concerns regarding the services that their library outsources to a third party…Or so one may think. Privacy is a core value of the American Library Association so no library employee is completely alone.  The Intellectual Freedom Committee’s Privacy Subcommittee, “monitors ongoing privacy developments in technology, politics and legislation, as well as social and cultural trends that impact individual privacy and confidentiality, both in libraries and the wider world.” They have developed many resources for library workers to utilize. 2020 would be a great time to conduct a privacy audit at your library!

","Jamie ","Larue","DeRay McKesson ACLU","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mckesson-435x326.jpg","","While the First Amendment has many dimensions, it’s clear that political speech, “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances,” is explicitly guaranteed. Or is it?","Or is it?","Consider the case of DeRay Mckesson. In 2016, the civil rights activist participated in a protest in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Its purpose was “to celebrate the life of Alton Sterling, a Black resident shot and killed by two on-duty police officers — and demand accountability and transformative change,” according to an ACLU press release. But during the protest, someone threw a rock and injured a police officer. The officer doesn’t allege that Mckesson threw the rock; but it does claim that he is responsible for the injuries “because he encouraged the protest.”","","Previous court rulings, most notably, NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., found that peaceful protesters can’t be held accountable for the violent acts of others. That same principle was used to shield President Trump against violence that occurred at his rallies. But the Fifth Court of Appeals ruled in August that the officer’s case could continue. The ACLU is correct that this precedent represents a profound threat to political speech. If it stands, one can interrupt protest of which one disapproves simply by throwing a rock at someone, then fading away, a type of heckler’s veto. ","","The fear of a lawsuit can be remarkably effective to “chill” speech. Protesters, in general, are not the most powerful or wealthiest segments of society. Rather, they are those who turn to protest because they lack more direct control of governmental apparatus. But if bad actors or provocateurs can turn a peaceful protest into a violent altercation, and fix the blame on protest organizers, free speech now faces an impossible burden. Or to put it another way, those who do control powerful interests can shut down speech with impunity.","","The ACLU has filed a “petition for a writ of certiorari” — a request to take up the case at a higher court.

I’ve run the numbers (really–I made a spreadsheet) and only 16% of the books I read in 2019 were physical books; the rest were all eBooks that I checked out from my public library. I respect that some people prefer the look, feel, texture, and smell of an actual book, but eBook usage and audiobook usage have increased–as have, of course, tensions between publishers and libraries. Amazon Publishing won’t allow libraries to lend their titles at all, and Macmillan’s embargo has sparked the #eBooksForAll initiative. eBooks, which were predicted by some to bring about an age of universal access, have instead provided more hurdles than ever, not even including the digital divide.","#eBooksForAll and the Incarcerated","I’ve written about prison libraries before, but recently, there’s been more and more talk about digital libraries at prisons and jails and other correctional facilities. For example, there are two on OverDrive: the National Institute of Corrections Library and the National Corrections Library (by American Prison Data Systems, or APDS). There are a lot of benefits to these collections: they include Spanish language materials and relate to relevant topics for inmates, such as re-entry and living with disabilities in prison. The NIC library even has a category specifically for women (although it would be nice to see a category for the LGBTQ+ community as well).  But it’s hardly surprising, given recent developments, that the existence of eBooks in prison libraries has not made information and entertainment more accessible to inmates. In fact, it’s made the whole matter a lot more complicated.   First, inmates need devices to obtain and read eBooks. Correctional facilities have largely adopted modified tablets to give to inmates, some states even providing them for free. In other facilities, however, inmates must purchase their own. Even when “free,” these tablets “charge users at every opportunity.” It can cost 35 cents to send an email, but more relevant to libraries, it can cost 5 cents a minute to read an eBook. ","","More egregiously, these tablets charge inmates to read books from Project Gutenberg–you know, the digital library of free eBooks, most of which are out of copyright? JPay, a tablet company, has recently eliminated these fees in response to backlash, and more than 25 states have followed their lead. Beyond price, however, there is still censorship. Many books don’t make it into prison library collections, physical or digital. In Pennsylvania, some of these books include the Autobiography of Malcolm X and The New Jim Crow. The Philadelphia Inquirer also reports that the digital translation of the Quran is considered “nonstandard” and “extremely offensive to most observant Muslims.” Moreover, the use of eBooks and tablets has led to a distressing trend where prisons are rejecting physical book donations. The risks of books being used to smuggle in contraband (claims of which are largely unsubstantiated), combined with the benefits of surveillance and profit from these tablets, make eBooks a more appealing option. Inmates might not have the option of reading a mass-market paperback versus the digital copy.  Fortunately, activist groups are calling attention to exploitative tablets, and their efforts have led to eBook fees being removed across state institutions. However, even on the outside, eBooks still don’t extend to all. ","ebooks and accessability","eBooks provide some benefits to readers with disabilities and vision impairments, like adjusting font sizes, color and contrast. (There are even dyslexia fonts, although they haven’t been shown to actually help with reading.) These features are a good start, but that’s all that they are: a start.  eBooks run into accessibility problems when it comes to screenreaders and digital rights management.

Robin Christopherson, who is the Head of Digital Inclusion at AbilityNet, said in an interview that the ePub 3 format, most commonly used for eBooks, “provides inclusive text, images with labels, and interactive links,” but “it’s not always used well.” Christopherson also points to the Digital Accessible Information SYstem (DAISY), which allows for greater navigability through the book and utilizes a text-to-speech (TTS) system. TTS “gives access to a much greater variety of material” than audiobooks, and it is often available much sooner than the audiobook version.

The Library Freedom Institute is part of the Library Freedom Project, born in 2015 to combat the increasing use of surveillance and data-mining by government and corporations. The purpose of LFI is to create privacy advocates who will fight these same fights within their communities and at local and state levels. The training, including a two-day, in-person workshop in New York City, is currently funded through grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This sounded like a cool opportunity to learn more about an area of librarianship I was fascinated by but not knowledgeable in. I frantically spent the next 24 hours preparing my application and expected to hear nothing more. To my intense shock and absolute delight, I was one of the 30 library employees chosen!","","For six months last year, we cohort members immersed ourselves in training on how to teach privacy to both library patrons and staff; how to install and use privacy tools in libraries; and how to advocate for privacy with community leaders and officials. We heard talks and lectures from amazing, passionate people who work all over the world, fighting against facial recognition and surveillance societies, teaching threat modeling, and creating conversations about the millions of way our privacy is eroding away. We learned how to evaluate vendor language to see what information they are collecting from our patrons, how to audit our data retention policies in our libraries, and how to guard against cyber threats. Working alongside these brilliant librarians, learning from our fearless leader, Alison Macrina, founder of the Library Freedom Project, has been one of the most thought-provoking, mind-blowing, and life-altering experiences of my life.","","You too, can be a Library Freedom Fighter! If you are a librarian interested in privacy awareness and advocacy (and odds are you are, because you are reading this), then apply to be part of the Library Freedom Institute’s Cohort 3. Do it for the professional development opportunity. Do it because you are learning and doing work worth doing. Do it because you will be joining a cadre of rock star librarians who are trying to change the world for the better. Applications are now open, and we want you! Learn more and find the application at https://libraryfreedom.org/index.php/lfi/. ","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020-04-01 12:00:00",0
1008,"Meeting Rooms and Sacred Spaces Cause Schisms in Seattle","Ross ","Sempek","Seattle Public Library, Photo by kconnors at Morguefile.com","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SPL-300x200.jpg","","Seattle Public Library is under scrutiny for the use of their auditorium by a controversial feminist group. The Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF) is scheduled to hold an event there in February, but their critics would rather they not show up at all, citing concerns over the content of their guiding principles and stance on trans identities. These groups fear that if such content gets normalized by being granted a venue at the public library, said assimilation will have a dehumanizing effect and lead to increased violence against transgender people.    Amid the looming pressure, director and chief librarian Marcellus Turner released a statement addressing the concerns of the polarizing event. The missive establishes that SPL will not cancel the event, but will hold the event outside of library hours and increase security. Mr. Turner cited their anti-discriminatory meeting room policies, as well as their commitment to intellectual freedom and resulting reluctance to stifle speech based on speakers’ perspectives.","","The library board of trustees president, Jay Reich, concurrently offered his own remarks in a piece that essentially echoed Mr. Turner’s espousal of intellectual freedom. In it Mr. Reich explicated the necessity of protecting controversial speech: censorship works both ways and can just as easily (and more severely) affect minority groups — already vulnerable populations whose lives would be exacerbated by speech restrictions. A similar conflict ensued north of the border just about a year ago when Megan Murphy, founder of feminist current, was slated to speak at the Vancouver Public Library. The trans community’s objections to this event were not dissimilar to those given voice in this contemporary account, and the response from the brass at VPL fell in line with what Mr. Turner and Reich explicated in their statements. And, I gotta say, to those in opposition to both of these, their response must sound like a tepid cop-out. It must feel disenchanting to see a trusted institution break bread with a group anathema to one’s existence. But, unfortunate as it may appear, this is the only position libraries can proffer.","","Public libraries, like many government agents, while certainly not inextricable from politics, exist in an apolitical milieu. Libraries don’t endorse, sanction, promote, or otherwise advocate for the views presented in their collection or events. It’s precisely because of this position that we can say that Libraries Are For Everyone. Note the lack of an asterisk at the end of that statement. It’s not; Libraries Are For Everyone…except those you disagree with. They’re for everyone and this is true if and only if everyone can use them. We don’t have to like it, but we also can’t dismantle it based on ideological leanings.","","Imagine if libraries in Oregon and Florida caved to the pressure from groups who railed against Drag Queen Story Time. Imagine if the Colorado Library Consortium nixed their EBSCO subscription because of a vitriolic vocal minority. Imagine if OBOB scrubbed “George” from their reading list to satisfy livid constituents. Controversy is understandably unwanted, but it is the driving force behind a library’s content. If libraries kowtowed to the exclusive tastes of patrons, our cherished institutions would cease to exist. Libraries will almost certainly carry materials one person or another will find controversial — it’s a byproduct of the human condition.  ","","So this is the unwavering position that libraries will continue to espouse in the face of the controversies that forge their existence. This is not the first, nor the last time libraryland will manage objections to collection development or programming. In fact it seems like a condition of existence. You can’t please everyone but when our mission is just that. It’s a difficult task to mitigate animosity when patrons feel that we fall short. Libraries do so much for their communities — they don’t deserve to become a battleground where activists quarrel to demand an espousal of ideological hierarchies. So as vexing as this is to me, it’s also encouraging. Jay Reich has it right when he said, “We believe that the honesty and passion we have heard on this topic speaks to the sacred nature of Library spaces.” Truer words… ","","Imagine if libraries in Oregon and Florida caved to the pressure from groups who railed against Drag Queen Story Time.

1009,"Prison Libraries: Shelves Bare and Minds Restless","Tommy","Vinh Bui","Chilliecothe Prison Library (ALA Archives)","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Chillicothe-Prison-Lib-wm.jpg","","It was a blustery downtown Los Angeles afternoon. Many a dust cloud being kicked up and the sheer tonnage of palm fronds creaking and careening onto the concrete in a kerrang alarming but a regular sight. Those Santa Ana winds were earning their notoriety today sending countless zephyrs to ruin carefully crafted coifs all over the city. Dresses ruffled. Ties sent askew.","","I was walking from Union Station to the nearby Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Twin Towers Correctional Facility lugging in tow two satchels of weeded and withdrawn books from my local library. Books that otherwise would gather dust on a sales cart or be julienned and mooshed into bales at a recycling center. I figured they would be of better use in amenable hands as donations. So I carefully sifted through and compiled a pretty decent collection of paperbacks, textbooks, and special interests books and lumped them all together and off I went to deliver them into the hands of interested parties hopefully.","","I arrived and imagine my chagrin when I learned that the front desk would not be receptive to receiving an unvetted cache of mystery items from a perfect stranger off the street. It was a hard no and have a nice day. In hindsight, I should’ve anticipated this response. The security issues and the liability concerns notwithstanding, there’s just a procedure in place for such endeavors. A procedure that I would eventually familiarize myself with but currently was inconsolable over the realization that I huffed and puffed these tomes for naught. At that very moment I was disheartened that I would be making that long trudge back burdened with not only the books but a sense of perplexity over how onerous something simple as getting reading material to prisoners shouldn’t have to be.","","In an environment where exposure to natural light is limited to sometimes a mere hour a day, the inward illumination that books are capable of providing should be something that is more accessible and available to inmates. But that is rarely the case for most prison libraries. From the prison administration’s perspective, the most pressing concern about donated books involve the possibility of smuggling contraband into the facility. Also, restrictions on what is deemed suitable for a prison library is heightening and the range of materials that actually get placed on the shelves gets narrower and narrower every day. Many prisons have stringent bans on what specific titles can reach the hands of inmates. Books that have been categorized as threats for their capability to possibly foment disorder and insurrection.","","The public outcry and backlash against certain prison policies preventing inmates access to books has been fully-voiced and effective. PEN America recently reported the prison policies as essentially censorship and deplorable and amounting to the nation’s largest book ban. Advocates for the rights of prisoners have mobilized to protest this egregious act of censorship by making appeals to the Supreme Court arguing that access to books and self-educational opportunities have rehabilitative and restorative qualities that cannot be overlooked. Studies have shown that prisoners with equitable and free access to books have a constructive outlet and increased productivity within a prison environment. Self-study also increases skills and job marketability upon release thus contributing to a declining recidivism rate. Making available books on a myriad of relevant and germane topics such as legal research, job training, and parenting guides have proven to be supremely useful to inmates. The long and short of it, books and education are critical to rehabilitation within the incarceration system.   ","","The positive impact of access to books within the prison system is quantifiable. Some prison systems refer to inmate library records when gauging parole eligibility. Prisons in Brazil and Italy have programs that allow inmates to shorten their sentences dependent upon how many books they can read and finish. There have also been studies that suggest that bibliotherapy amongst prisoners help ameliorate the effects of depression and psychological distress during their sentences.","","The current state of many prison libraries is dire. Budgets are constantly being slashed and funds for new books dwindle further day by day. And prison librarian positions are becoming more difficult to staff as a result. Though things may seem bleak they’re nary hopeless. There are an assortment of organizations and nonprofits that combat censorship and advocate tirelessly for the rights of prisoners to read freely. Organizations such as Reading Reduces Recidivism and the Prisoners Literature Project are just two that champion the cause of getting books and access to education for prisoners. I lumber on down the street with my unwieldy bouquets of books; forearms straining from the heft of knowledge that will go un-acquired by inquisitive minds for the time being. Though my attempts to impart curiosity and literary respite to folks clamoring for it were momentarily foiled that afternoon, I took solace in knowing that headway was being made to change prison policies. And that the deprivation of books and curbing of avenues to self-improvement for prisoners was slowly being curtailed. But in the meantime, these books are still heavy. And remain unflipped-thru and woefully stowed from any eager eyes.

1010,"So Your Second Cousin is a Criminal and Other DNA Privacy Concerns ","Kelly","Bilz","","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dna-3656587_640.jpg","","Whether you’re a true crime enthusiast or a genealogy geek, you’ve probably heard about how DNA has been used to convict criminals for cold cases: a 1984 homicide case in Wisconsin, a 1967 murder (the oldest case when it was reported in May), and most famously, the Golden State Killer. (It bears repeating: the Golden State Killer!!!!!) These crimes were solved using the relatively new field of genetic (or forensic) genealogy, using DNA matches from direct-to-consumer (DTC) kits, like those from Ancestry.com or 23 and Me, to narrow a list of suspects in a police investigation. Genetic testing kits go on sale around the holidays, so before you put one on your gift list, here’s the ways your DNA data could be used. Genealogy–genetic or otherwise–is full of all kinds of unexpected discoveries, but normally, they’re the kind that happened upwards of 70 years ago. With genetic genealogy, if DNA matches that could share less than 1% of DNA (the amount shared by 3rd cousins is 0.78%), investigators can build family trees: one to find the common ancestor, and the other to work forward to the present day. You can see the process at work with renowned genetic genealogist, CeCe Moore, here.","","But how much access does law enforcement legally have? This November, a warrant was issued in Florida for access to GEDmatch, a genealogy site, to search its database for DNA matches. This could pave the way for similar warrants to be made at other sites like 23andMe and Ancestry.com. GEDmatch has over a million users (who have not consented to the search), but that’s a small following compared to Ancestry.com and 23andMe. This, naturally, has people concerned about the privacy of their data. ","","Companies offering consumer genetic testing are trying to tighten up their privacy policies. Although it varies by state (and which site has been given a warrant), companies are lobbying to keep DNA data protected and to uphold the policy of their users through policy. They aren’t going down without a fight, which, if you’re one of the 26 million who have had their DNA tested, is a bit of relief.   On the other hand, these privacy measures have drawn criticisms. Great, so no one knows you’re 80% Irish–and murderers just go free? In New York, in a story published just three days after the warrant in Florida, we hear another side of the story: a victim’s family whose state policies restrict this use of DNA evidence. In this case, bureaucracy and equipment seem to be the culprits, rather than privacy concerns, but these added restrictions do slow down investigations that, yes, could lead to the arrests of violent criminals. It’s a difficult balance between privacy and safety. ","","One thing that’s important to consider is the reach that DNA has: whether or not you’ve submitted a test yourself, your cousin might have. Your second cousin could have. Your third cousin, potentially, could have. And, especially if you’re of European descent, that makes you particularly easy to find. According to Kaiser Health News, the DNA from these websites will make 90% of Americans of European descent identifiable. Genetic genealogy is perhaps the only thing about our justice system that affects white people (well, more accurately, people of European descent) more than minoritized communities. (Maybe that’s why it’s being taken so seriously?) The point is, this isn’t data you can “opt out” of. If that relative you met once at a reunion ten years ago gets the genealogy bug, your DNA and your genealogical profile could become part of an investigation. ","","You might also consider is that genetic genealogy can be wrong, mistaken, or misinterpreted. And if you are wrongfully convicted, depending on your state’s laws, further DNA testing might not save you anyway (which you can read more about on the Innocence Project website). Another factor to consider: DNA evidence is costly and time-consuming. Yet another factor: immense backlogs (like, most notoriously, the rape kit backlog). The thing is, a lot has been written about the “CSI Effect,” or expectations that courtroom cases must involve DNA evidence. Even John Mulaney jokes about running evidence through CODIS (and takes a dig at Dennis Fung from the O.J. Simpson trial–another landmark case regarding the use of DNA evidence). But DNA and consumer genetic testing kits aren’t only being used for criminal investigations (and, you know, the genealogical research that probably started it off). ","","Ancestry.com now offers an AncestryHealth kit, and consumer DNA testing kits are used for health-related purposes as well. As said previously, the sampling for these companies is predominantly from people with European ancestry, resulting in knowledge gaps for those not of European descent (mostly people of color). This lack of diversity can lead to inaccurate or misleading results, and for many consumers, the results can be difficult to understand, anyway. Another thing you have to look out for are fake DNA kits–as if you needed another scam to worry about, or needed more proof that people want your data.  Advances in DNA and genetic genealogy can lead to breakthroughs in family trees as well as cold cases. Before you buy that DNA testing kit that’s been marked down for Christmas (or Father’s Day, or Mother’s Day), just make sure you think about the risks, too.

Don’t Make Me Laugh: Censorship and Comedy ","Kelly","Bilz","Image from Pixabay","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/microphone-3989881_640.jpg","This Content is Rated PC for Political Correctness","Stand-up comedy is a staple form of entertainment for college campuses, and many performers rely on the college circuit for their gigs. However, many comedians–most notably, Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld–refuse to perform there. The campus environment has become too “PC,” and the audience too critical and too offended, for comedy, they argue.  Other comedians who have performed on campuses written that the culture has definitely changed, although some argue that the change isn’t as drastic, nor destructive, as others make it seem to be. Free speech on college campuses has come under fire not only for comedy, but for a variety of speaking engagements. Nonetheless, this debate has been raging for several years now, exacerbated by cancel culture as well as debates about freedom of speech.","","It does have a real effect: in 2018, Andy Gross removed himself from the college circuit after a performance at Purdue, and at the University of Utah, there were calls to cancel (as in literally cancel) David Cross’s appearance that same year. (David Cross did perform, though, and according to the Salt Lake Tribune, “the good-size crowd…ate it up, cheering and hooting in approval.”)  In many cases, it’s censorship in the unofficial sense–it’s not what the Hays Code was for film–but even though it’s not officially mandated or enforced, this censorship affects many comedians today who rely on the college circuit for their gigs.  Comedy is hard work. It’s pretty brutal. You know that silence that follows when a joke falls flat? And then there’s dealing with hecklers, too? No. I could never do what comedians do, so I’m not telling them how to do their job.  It’s a matter of finding your audience and knowing it, and for some comedians, that’s not a college campus. Or maybe it is in a college town, but it’s in a comedy club or bar, not an auditorium. Because I don’t think students are the problem; it goes much higher than that. ","The Kids Are Alright","This is my generation (to make another reference to The Who), having been an undergraduate not too long ago and still being on a college campus. I work with university students, and I have observed younger generations being more critical. I’ll show them materials from the archives, like a yearbook from the 1960s, and they’ll point out the lack of diversity. They weren’t offended; they were correct. Students today just have a higher standard of integrity and how people should be treated.   Besides, I’m sure plenty of college kids in the 1980s were offended by the comedians they watched; the difference is that kids in the 1980s didn’t have the same platform to share their critiques. I mean, they could write in the student newspaper, but with social media, stories can go viral overnight. That’s not only a threat to the comedian’s reputation, but the school’s.  ","","So, it’s not surprising that comedians go through a vetting process before being added to the roster. The National Association for Campus Activities (NACA) goes through audition videos combing for appropriate material. Campus bookers, interviewed by Vice, also evaluate comedians’ acts for potential problematic material, especially jokes about sexual assault and/or the LGBTQ+ community. (Again, comedy is subjective, and I’m not a comedian, but perhaps making jokes about LBTQ+ stereotypes to one of the most openly gay, trans*, etc. generations just isn’t a great idea?) It’s not the “snowflakes” who are censoring comedy; there are a series of gatekeepers in place. ","","Plenty of comedians still do college gigs–and perhaps the undergraduate audiences are more open than administrators give them credit for–but these events aren’t mandatory. If students don’t like a set, they can leave. However, booking a comedian is a financial investment, so the higher-ups want to choose somebody who’s good, as well as somebody who won’t cause problems. NACA and campus bookers want to create positive experiences for students, as well as to avoid negative press, and they certainly have their work cut out for them. I don’t envy their jobs, either.  But, comedy fans, rest assured: comedy clubs are actually on the rise, so you don’t have to worry about colleges killing comedy.

Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, was ostensibly testifying about the company’s plans to release a cryptocurrency called Libra. However, some members of Congress used it as a chance to grill Zuckerberg about other concerns regarding the social media giant.  Questions ranged from biases in Facebook’s advertising algorithms, the Cambridge Analytica breech, and fact checking of political advertising. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez asked Zuckerberg about political advertising. While Zuckerberg said lying in advertising “is bad,” he declined to agree to remove false advertising, saying that whether a post is removed “depends on the context.” Similarly, Cindy Axne of Iowa asked how Facebook plans to prevent election interference. She also asked about what data the company collects indirectly on people who are not Facebook users. ","","Zuckerberg seemed to acknowledge these concerns when he said “I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now. We’ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years.”  Facebook has also recently faced calls to “break up” the company. This movement also includes a probe by state attorneys general into whether Facebook has engaged in any antitrust abuses. Closer to home in the library world, ALA recently sent a report to the House Judiciary Committee investigating digital market competition regarding MacMillan’s recent decision to impose an embargo on new e-book releases to libraries. ","","This serves as a good reminder that technology brings so many benefits and challenges for librarians. Privacy concerns have spiked in the library community recently following the acquisition of Lynda.com by LinkedIn. We certainly know many of our patrons are using social media. I believe that these challenges are only going to become more complex and that librarians can serve a central role in educating our patrons and the public in general on privacy concerns and the other ethical issues surrounding technology.

Little else prickles a librarian’s sense of propriety more than encountering a book that’s been vandalized. Something snarky scribbled in the margins objecting to the contents contained therein. It’s always the same garbled diatribe about inappropriateness or misplaced indignation over its ready availability in a public space. These same books can usually be found tucked under couch cushions or wedged in some dark crevice within the library in a futile attempt to censor our shelves.  ","","But sometimes found in the smoldering ashes of attempted-censorship surfaces something that can invoke more awareness and discussion about the dastardly act itself. Employing a little insight and creativity, taking this woeful scenario and kneading it into a singular opportunity. From a situation seemingly destructive and imbuing it with something irrepressibly redemptive. And that’s exactly what ensued at one crafty and resilient library. ","","The genesis of the Reversing Vandalism project began when the books of the San Francisco Public Library’s James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center were being anonymously pilfered from the shelves and found mutilated and concealed all over the premises. The obscuring of certain texts was deliberate and the intent brazenly malicious. Approximately six hundred books that pertained to LGBTQ issues, AIDS, and women’s health were scattered and hidden all over the library with pages carved or shorn altogether. Volumes and volumes of violated tomes. An all too wanton textbook example of a hate crime and violent censorship was transpiring. Unfortunately the spoiled books were found to be beyond repair and had to consequently be withdrawn from the library’s circulating collection. Eventually the perpetrator of this underhanded deed was brought to justice leaving behind a precarious pile of defaced books for the staff of the library to contend with.","","But that was no challenge for intrepid historian-librarian James Van Buskirk who compiled the books and contrived to spirit them off to various artists all over the country to readapt and repurpose into works of art. What resulted was a rich and collective artistic response to the damnable act of censorship and infringement on the right to read. The reply was remarkably enthusiastic and compelled an overwhelming level of community support and civic involvement. Artists contributed thoughtful artworks that included a wide range of mixed-media such as sculpture, assemblage, photography, textiles, along with a diversity of other mediums. The transformation of a tragic pile of tattered books into lively expressions of beauty and healing is a spirit-buoying phenomena.

I’d be hard pressed to find a more satisfying example of taking an untenable incident and converting it into a teachable moment that evokes compassion, empathy, and understanding. And that’s the optimistic mindset in which I desperately cleave to whenever I uncover yet another controversial book crammed in yet another poorly-lit cranny of the library in an attempt to smother intellectual freedom. This whole episode reminds me that progress is slow-going but lumbers along resolutely. Comfort can be found in knowing that there’re librarians out there unflagging in their mandate to empower under-heard voices and promote tolerance within their book aisles.  It happened then, it happens today, and it’ll happen again. I reshelve the book returning it to its proper place in the sightline of any curious patrons. An act that elicits both a weary sigh of exasperation but also a wry smile knowing that it’s a revitalizing antidote against cultural suppression and erasure.","","It happened then, it happens today, and it’ll happen again.

1014,"Teaching Disinformation Literacy","Jamie ","Gregory","From IFLA [CC BY 4.0]","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/How_to_Spot_Fake_News-730x973.jpg","","Last week, I collaborated with a senior English teacher to create a breakout box activity featuring disinformation. Beforehand, the teacher and I had a discussion about teaching information literacy skills and fake websites versus disinformation (here is one famously circulated among librarians and English teachers). I’ll just assume you knew that one was fake. But to be honest, some high school students I’ve taught looked at that website and thought it was real. The drawback to approaching information literacy skills with fake websites is that real research would never lead to sites like the tree octopus or the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide. Disinformation, spreading false information with malicious and purposeful intent, is much more nuanced. What would students do with sites such as Infowars or BeforeItsNews.com? ","","If a high school student in Government or Economics class is researching political parties or an upcoming election using open web searches, sites spreading disinformation will certainly be accessed. And then what? Enter a student’s own biases and lack of information literacy skills. Many educators are now familiar with the Stanford study revealing the abilities (or lack thereof) of middle school, high school, and college students (and here is a newly published study). Can you distinguish among advertisements, sponsored content, and articles? If you read a Tweet, can you evaluate the political motivations behind it and whether or not it may spread biased information? Can you confidently determine if a photograph is real or has been Photoshopped? These skills matter if a student wants to use these sources as research. These skills are much more valuable, needed, and difficult to teach. In my state of South Carolina, a few high school courses are ruled by End-of-Course exams which count as 20% of a student’s final grade and, as you might have already guessed, are created and scored by employees at the State Department of Education. Teachers of these courses are basically forced to worry more about this one standardized assessment than helping students reach the goals laid out in the Profile of the High School Graduate. It’s impossible to integrate knowing how to learn, integrity, self-direction, media and technology skills if your sole classroom focus is on a multiple choice exam. Teaching information literacy skills takes a lot of time. Students need a lot of practice, and it needs to be real-world practice, not in the fake laboratory of the made-up websites by educators trying to teach website evaluation. It also helps just to have students think, which requires going beyond textbook reading and PowerPoint lecture notes. Not developing critical thinking skills has serious real-world effects on all of us.","","Consider developing lesson plans including the following examples of disinformation.","","A lack of common sense and drawing conclusions without evidence is how we end up with Pizzagate, a conspiracy theory in 2016 linking a local restaurant with prominent Democrats like Hillary Clinton and accusations of child sex trafficking. Pizzagate culminated with an armed man firing a shot inside the restaurant. Thankfully no one was injured. ","Consider developing lesson plans including the following examples of disinformation.","How about determining whether or not an event actually happened? It’s a bit difficult to follow Alex Jones’s deranged thinking, claiming the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax. According to one theory, CNN used a green screen in its coverage. It seems believable to some that the government or gun control supporters staged the shooting to give their arguments more credibility. In a bizarre comment, Jones did blame his opinions on a form of psychosis, which sounds promising, until you read that he claims the psychosis is a result of the perpetual, insistent, incessant lies of the mainstream media. In a separate lawsuit, Leonard Pozner, whose six year-old son was murdered, actually underwent DNA testing to prove that his son was indeed murdered in order to stop the defamation. I don’t think we could find a more despicable example of the effects of disinformation than that.","","Ever heard someone question the worth of vaccines? It’s all because of disinformation. Dr. Wakefield’s study has officially been retracted, but the damage has been done. Even though Wakefield’s study only included 12 children and he was paid for his research, people are still buying it. The CDC reports that in 2019 the majority of those who contract the measles were unvaccinated. A lack of basic scientific knowledge also lends credibility to the vaccination scare. Vaccinateyourfamily.org, although biased in favor of vaccinations, provides helpful infographics explaining how immunity works. Have students consider how some websites may be biased, but in a positive way.","","Other ways we see the effects of disinformation? In libraries, of course. On November 5, it was reported that a county library system in Citrus County, Florida, may not be purchasing a digital subscription to the New York Times for its patrons because stakeholders don’t agree with it (this article reports that it will be back on the board’s November 19 agenda). Commissioner Scott Carnahan is quoted as saying, “I don’t agree with it, I don’t like them” because “fake news, okay, I agree with President Trump.” (The President has called for federal agencies to stop subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post.) A small group of people cannot prevent others from accessing the information they seek based on their own personal preferences. Even the President cannot tell other citizens what to read and then prevent access. Moreover, it harms democracy not to simply dislike anything with which you disagree, but to claim any opposition or criticism is fake and harmful and should be stopped. (Please read the American Library Association’s response statement.)","","Furthermore, have students read about people who create fake news. A teen in Macedonia created fake news during the 2016 presidential election and profited greatly. Students could debate the free speech limits of creating disinformation, especially in light of how its spread can be highly influential, damaging, even potentially deadly. Or share this story, about how Cameron Harris created fake news stories during the 2016 presidential election. You might want to point out I just linked to a New York Times article. (Maybe stick with this NPR interview.)","","For extended First Amendment discussions, ask students to read about Twitter’s recent decision not to post political ads, announced by CEO Jack Dorsey. Read over the recently released document “Teaching and Learning with Twitter,” published in connection with UNESCO. Include Elizabeth Warren’s fake ad experiment on Facebook, deliberately running misinformation to prove a point. Should Facebook allow free speech to go unchecked and unverified, or should it follow Twitter’s lead? Disinformation literacy encompasses much more than website evaluation. Knowing your own biases, focusing on reading widely across all spectrums, and engaging in open, researched, and civil debates are solutions which teachers can use to combat the preventable spread of disinformation.","","For extended First Amendment discussions, ask students to read about Twitter’s recent decision not to post political ads, announced by CEO Jack Dorsey.

Shuffling my feet through the stacks and from shelf to shelf. All’s calm and only that low frequency hum of people quietly reading pervades the air. I make my way to our newspapers and periodicals and see the usual cadre of information-seekers. Thumbs darkened with smeared ink and outsized dailies contorted in varying angles and folds.","","This corner of the library is reliably populated. Our variety of newspapers are the items most crinkled from patron to patron. Patrons pining for information from what the weather holds in store for Cincinnati on Thursday to what movies are playing at midnight somewhere on the westside. It’s the go-to for being in the know in our local little corner of Los Angeles County.","","It gets this librarian thinking about the intertwined objectives of the two august institutions of librarianship and journalism. The intersections of the two industries are significant. The fourth estate of journalism and the beacon of light and knowledge that are libraries working hand in hand to produce a well-informed and discerning society. Both fields trade in carefully sourced  and vetted facts as a mainstay and both take on an unmoving position of neutrality to successfully serve their citizenry. Blazing a path together in tandem toward that common goal of a population that can consume information mindfully and invoke considered thought and public dialogue on a number of important community issues.","","Libraries have long been a haven and trustworthy source of community information. An epicenter of knowledge that can help patrons make informed decisions and guide them to other reliable information and credible and primary resources. It’s a need that the library has historically addressed ably. And little uplifts a community more markedly than empowering patrons to seek and research issues that effect them independently. Basically transforming regular citizens into becoming their own clear-thinking journalists and best advocates for themselves.","","Librarians and journalists tackle the same challenges and it’s no surprise that the two fields have found natural allies in one another. Both institutions champion the notion of equity in access and intellectual freedoms within their respective mandates. And collaboration is key when one falls short of their charge to serve the community. In this digital age of divisive discourse and polarizing punditry, libraries remain relatively unscathed from the melee and consequently uncompromised enough to help patrons navigate the disorienting detritus of misinformation and the flotsam of news overload. Libraries today are working closely with journalists and news outlets to promote the virtues of media literacy to the youth and imbue patrons with the tools to identify false information. Educating communities with the ability and incisive eye to not be too swayed by convincing but possibly ill-contrived pseudo-reportage that is all too common a staple of social media is a core objective of libraries. Beyond providing accountable resources and access to verifiable information, libraries also foster a sense of useful and positive civic engagement and encourage the youth to become veritable journalists in their own right and pursue good information-gathering behavior and embark on reporting projects within their own community. It’s empowerment at its best and most forthright.","","I tip-toe away from the newspaper section of our library and wend my way back to the reference desk. Where I crack open the local daily I managed to commandeer from the stacks. I lean back into my chair fitfully but comforted full-well knowing what’s currently transpiring in that particular corner of the library. Democracy remains robust. Our citizens compelled and engaged. And the civic fabric of the community unyielding under the strain of the hurly-burly of today’s digital discord. ","","Democracy remains robust. Our citizens compelled and engaged.

1016,"Ethics of Analysis: Learning Analytics and Academic Libraries","Kelly","Bilz","Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay","https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/notebook-336634_640.jpg","","Since getting into the swing of the new semester, something that has been on my mind is the role of the library in students’ success. Georgia State University (GSU) has taken this role very seriously, implementing a novel method to make sure they can help students who are struggling, namely, by using learning analytics. This was a massive undertaking on GSU’s part, using data from students (over 40,000 of them), identifying risk factors (800, to be specific), and having “interventions” based on alerts when students were falling behind. Listening to Vice Provost Timothy Renick describe the outcomes of using learning analytics, GSU has had some undeniable successes. Other universities and higher-education institutions have taken note, including academic libraries, and they have begun to invest in learning analytics themselves.","","Learning analytics was listed as one of 2018’s top trends for academic libraries by the Association of College and Research Libraries. Learning analytics, the ACRL says, means “tying the use of library materials and services to student performance measures, such as GPA and retention rates.” However, the ACRL notes that learning analytics has drawn criticism from privacy and intellectual freedom advocates.  Collecting data in a library setting isn’t new: circulation statistics, assessment measures, and user surveys are not only useful, they’re critical for enhancing the library’s services, as well as communicating the library’s value to stakeholders. So what makes learning analytics so different? ","","First, there are concerns about collecting and using user data in an ethical way. Kyle M. L. Jones and Dorothea Salo, in their article, “Learning Analytics and the Academic Library: Professional Ethics Commitments at a Crossroads,” raise the question of students’ data when it comes to negotiations with content vendors: “it (learning analytics) creates conditions where institutions and content vendors may use data as a bartering chip in contract negotiations.” Jones and Salo also argue that learning analytics is a threat to intellectual freedom, as it “negatively affects the conditions necessary for the free pursuit and dissemination of ideas by tracking and influencing behaviors.” Student might be more hesitant to research what they are curious about, and doesn’t that completely undermine the library’s mission? ","","Data collection, in fact, is only half of the story. The next step of learning analytics is predictive analytics, including a process called nudging. Nudging means “prompting individuals to modify their behavior in a predictable way (usually to make wiser decisions) without coercing them, forbidding actions, or changing consequences,” according to this article from the Educause Review. There’s a theory around nudging that predates learning analytics, and it’s distinct from its counterparts, “shoving” and “smacking,” which are coercive or punitive. The idea behind learning analytics is that, if students show signs of falling behind, they can somehow be “nudged” into, say, meeting with an advisor or going to a tutoring session. For libraries, students can be “nudged” to meet with a reference librarian or use any other of the library’s services.","","With learning management systems like Canvas and Blackboard moving much of the classroom into the digital landscape, the classroom has become less of a lecture hall and more of a computerized panopticon where students are constantly surveilled. Zoe Fisher, who gave an excellent rebuttal of the practice at the 2018 California Academic & Research Libraries conference, argued that learning analytics “conflates data tracking and surveillance with library assessment.” Jones and Salo, as well as Sarah Hartman-Caverly, in her book chapter “Our ‘Special Obligation’: Library Assessment, Learning Analytics, and Intellectual Freedom,” also recognize learning analytics as a form of surveillance. Even if the data is effectively anonymized, students still know that they’re being watched, and that doesn’t make the library–or the university–a safe space for inquiry.","","One of GSU’s biggest achievements from using learning analytics was gains among students from underrepresented groups. But April Hathcock traces data collection/analysis to the history of colonization and enslavement. For GSU, learning analytics could have, as they claim, provided support for minority students, but in most cases, data collection targets–and threatens–minority students the most. Hathcock also raises the point of students’ consent to this extensive data collection. Hartman-Caverly, similarly, refers to the methods of collecting students’ data as “surreptitious.”  I’m a student myself, so this issue weighs heavily on my mind. Is learning analytics used to change the library, or is it used to change students’ behavior? Is the end objective improved service, or control?  Fisher’s critique includes the following quote from Canadian researcher Lise Doucette: “I always ask, ‘What would you do if the results were opposite of what you expected? What if library use was correlated with NEGATIVE student outcomes? e.g., the more students used the library, the worse their grades were?’” These questions point out the biggest problem with analytics: if there was a negative correlation, what toll would it take on the university’s view of the library, or the library’s budget, or students’ trust?  On the other hand, if it only confirms the library’s assumption, what use does learning analytics have as an assessment tool? If it’s not to improve services, and if it’s such a threat to ethics, what are we doing all this for? Perhaps we should have a clear answer before putting the profession on the line.","","One of GSU’s biggest achievements from using learning analytics was gains among students from underrepresented groups.
